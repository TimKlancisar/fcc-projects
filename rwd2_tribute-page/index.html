              is a Japanese professional 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank">go</a>
              player from the 19th century. He is known for his undefeated streak of 19 games during the annual castle games; thirty-game match with Ota Yuzo; lead innovator of the eponymous Shusaku opening for Black; post-death ascension to one of the Go Sages; and next to his teacher, Honinbo Shuwa, considered to have been the strongest player from 1847/8 to his death in 1862. He was nicknamed Invincible Shusaku because of his castle games performance.
